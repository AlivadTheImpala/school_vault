This repository holds my Obsidian Vault, thus why some of the files seem to only contain words inside brackets.

# What's the "school_vault?"
It started when I wanted a local system to take school notes. I originally used Notion, but wasnt to fond of my data not being available offline if I needed it. I found obsidian and liked the simplicity of it, but I had never heard of markdown so learning the syntax was rough. 

Luckily though after a few quarters in my web dev degree, I felt comfortable learning the main things that mattered for my needs. I still wanted a way to back up my notes so I found a guide on how to create a github repo and have it backup only after I make a few changes to a file.

So here we are!
