# 9.1 Structure of DNA
## Discovery
The structure of DNA was first seen because of the culmination of the work of many scientists in the 1950's

- Francis Crick & James Watson worked out of Cambridge university England to determine structure of DNA
- Linus Pauling: Discovered the secondary structure of proteins using [[X-Ray crystallography]]
- Maurice Wilkins: 
	- Rosaline Franklin: used [[X-Ray crystallography]] in Wilkins' Lab
- Watson and Crick used Rosaline Franklins data to piece together the DNA molecule.
- Watson and Crick also used the [[Chargaff rule]]

## The Building Blocks
There are two types of **nucleic acid.
- Deoxyribonucleic acid: DNA
- Ribonucleic acid: RNA
Both are made of *three parts. *
- a deoxyribose/ribose (5-carbon sugar)
- a phosphate group
- a [[nitrogenous base]]

The phosphate bonds covalently with the sugar molecule creating the back-bone of each strand of DNA. The nucleotide base sticks out from this backbone.
In its natural state, each DNA molecule is actually composed of two single strands held together along their length with hydrogen bonds between the bases.

Base-pairing occurs between the two strands of DNA between purines and pyramdines A pairs with T, and G pairs with C. Because these pairs are so complimentary, you can find equal amounts of guanine as there is cytosine, and as mch adenine as there is thymine.

### Structure of RNA
The other nucleic acid is Ribonucleic acid. The difference between them is the 5 carbon sugar that is present, ribose vs the deoxyribose in DNA. Ribose has a hydroxyl group at the 2' carbon, unlike deoxyribose, which has only a hydrogen atom

RNA also **DOES NOT** contain Thymine, instead they have Uracil. 

RNA is a single strand rather than a double stranded helix like DNA and there are many different versions of RNA depending on their role
- [[Messenger RNA: mRNA]]
- [[Transfer RNA: tRNA]]
- [[Ribsomal RNA: rRNA]]

## How DNA is Arranged in a cel
![[Screenshot 2023-02-06 at 18.39.53.png]]
DNA is essentially coiled in on itself in what is known as supercoiling. Some proteins are involved in the supercoiling process while other proteins and enzymes help maintain the structure. 

the protein Histone, is wrapped by the DNA forming a structure called a nucleosome. These nucleosomes are linked together by strands of DNA that are free, and uncoiled, like a bead of pearls.

# 9.2 DNA Replication
DNA replication occurs during the synthesis phase (S phase) of the cell cycle, before the cell enters [[mitosis]] or [[meiosis]]

Because DNA contains two strands, each with a complimentary "plug", this suggests that the two strands of the double helix seperates during replication. These strands then serve as a template to form a new "child strand"

Remember that each nucleotide always pairs with its counterpart. A to T and G to C

## DNA Replication in Eukaryotes
Three main stages of DNA replication
- Initiation
- Elongation
- Termination

### **Inititiation**
There are specific nucleotide sequences called origins of replication where replication begins. These are the points where DNA inside of the nucleosome bundle is exposed to the enzymes and proteins responsible for replication.

An enzyme called [[Helicase]] unwinds and opens up the DNA Helix. This creates a y-shaped structure called replication forks where DNA is sequenced.

### **Elongation**
Remember that each strand of DNA (the backbones) has a 3' end and a 5'end. During elongation, [[DNA Polymerase]] (an enzyme) adds DNA nucleotides to the the 3' end of the strand. A primer sequence with RNA nucleotides is added to begin the sequence, but is removed later. 

The leading strand of DNA is continuously synthesized while the lagging strand is synthesized in chunks called [[Okazaki fragments]]. 

### **Termination**

As synthesis proceeds an enzyme removes the RNA primer and replaces it with DNA nucleotides. [[DNA Ligase]] (enzyme) then connects the gaps between the DNA strands

>[!From the Book]
>The process of DNA replication can be summarized as follows:
>1. DNA unwinds at the origin of replication.
>2. New bases are added to the complementary parental strands. One new strand is made continuously, while the other strand is made in pieces.
>3. Primers are removed, new DNA nucleotides are put in place of the primers and the backbone is sealed by DNA ligase.

## Telomere Replication
Chromosomes in eukarytoic organisms are linear. The DNA replication continues until it reaches the ends of a chromosome tail known as a [[Telomere]]. Because the lagging strand of DNA is made in chunks eventually it falls behind the leading strand and has no way of pairing with the leading strand. [[Telomerase]] attaches to the end of  the chromosome adding complementary bases to the RNA template. once the lagging strand is sufficiently elongated, [[DNA Polymerase]] can now add nucleotides that are complementary to the ends of the chromosome
