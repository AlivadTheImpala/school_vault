# Promises


> [!NOTE] From Masteringjs.io
> [Promises in JavaScript](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/fundamentals/promise)Â are an object representation of an asynchronous computation.

Promises are an idea of something that hasn't happened yet. I promise that in a few minutes I'll get an apple. Making that promise doesn't actually materialize that apple however. To actually get a material apple, means getting up and grabbing the apple.
