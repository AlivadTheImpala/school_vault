Probability Notation 

  

This short handout is designed to provide you with an overview of notation for probability. Feel free to print it and use it until you are familiar with the notation. This handout is not intended to review how to compute probabilities, just the notation. 

  

If we wish to indicate "the probability it will rain tomorrow," we use the notation "P(rain tomorrow)." We can abbreviate the probability of anything. If we let A represent what we wish to find the probability of, then P(A) would represent that probability.

  

We call A as an "event," and use capital letters to denote events.  However, we can also simply use words (like “rain tomorrow” to describe events. So…

  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Notation|Meaning|
|P(A)|The probability that the event A will happen.|
|P(B)|The probability that event B will happen.|
|P(win lottery)|The probability that a person who has a lottery ticket will win that lottery.|

  

We can also talk about the probability that an event will NOT happen. If A is an event, then we let AC be the event that A does NOT happen. So…

  

|          |                                                                             |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Notation | Meaning                                                                     |
| P(A^C)   | The probability that event A will NOT happen.                               |
| P(A')    | Sometimes this notation is used for the probability that A will not happen. |

  

Note that there is a simple relationship between P(A) and P(A^C). Since the event  A either happens or it does not happen, then 

P(A) + P(A^C)=1

  

We can rewrite this so that finding the probability that A does not happen is easy if we know the probability A will happen. 

P(A^C)=1-P(A)

---

If have more than one event to consider we have additional notation that we use.

  

If we want to know the probability that BOTH events A AND B happen, then we use the ∩ intersection symbol.  So the probability that both A and B happen is written as P(A ∩ B)  

  

If we want to know the probability that EITHER event A OR B happens, then we use the ∪ union symbol.  So the probability that either A or B happens is written as  P(A ∪ B)

  

We also can talk about “conditional probability.”  If we want to know the probability that event A happens given that we know event B happens, we write that as P(A|B).  It’s important to know that P(A|B)is not the same as P(B|A). They will typically give you different numerical value for those probabilities. The formula for each of these is:

P(A|B)=P(AB)P(B)

  

P(B|A)=P(AB)P(A)

  

As you can see, each one divides by a different probability, so that will typically make the conditional probabilities different from each other.

  

Putting this all together, we have the following…

  

|                |                                                                               |

| P(A)           | The probability that the event A will happen.                                 |

| P(A∪B)         | The probability that either A OR B happens                                    |
| P(A\|B)        | The probability that event A happens given that we know event B happens       |
| P(B\|A)        | The probability that event B happens given that we know event A happens       |
