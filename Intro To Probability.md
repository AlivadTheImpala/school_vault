What is probability: 
	In essence probability allows you to make a reasonable inference about how a random sample might represent a population. Because random samples are random, theres a likely-hood that the sample chosen would represent the population well, but there might also be a chance that it does not. Probability allows you to quantify how much a random sample may vary from a given population.
Probability of Events:
	when we want to figure out the probability of an event, we are asking what the likelihood of the even is to occur. P(A) can be read as "the probability that even A will occur."
	- The probability that an event, A ,  will occur is between 0 and 1.
