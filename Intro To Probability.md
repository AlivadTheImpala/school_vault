What is probability: 
	In essence probability allows you to make a reasonable inference about how a random sample might represent a population. Because random samples are random, theres a likely-hood that the sample chosen would represent the population well, but there might also be a chance that it does not. Probability allows you to quantify how much a random sample may vary from a given population.
Probability of Events:
- when we want to figure out the probability of an event, we are asking what the likelihood of the even is to occur. P(A) can be read as "the probability that even A will occur."
- The probability that an event, A ,  will occur is between 0 and 1. 
	- 0≤P(A) ≤ 1.
	-  The closer the probability is to 0, the less likely the event is to occur. The closer the probability is to 1, the more likely the event is to occur.

Types of Probability 
- Classical (Theoretical)
- Observational (Empirical)
Classical is typically used for games of chance and is referred to as classical because the values are dependent on the game itself.

> [!example]
> Each traditional (cube-shaped) die has six sides, marked in dots with the numbers 1 through 6. On a "fair" die, these numbers are equally likely to end up face-up when the die is rolled. Thus, P(1) = P(2) = P(3) = P(4) = P(5) = P(6) = 1/6 or about 0.167.
> - Here, again, is a practical use of classical probability. Suppose six people go out to dinner. You want to randomly decide who will pick up the check and pay for everyone. Again, the P(each person) = 1/6.

When we run a simulation or when we use a random sample and record the results, we are using **empirical** probability.
