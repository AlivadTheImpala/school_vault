What is probability: 
	In essence probability allows you to make a reasonable inference about how a random sample might represent a population. Because random samples are random, theres a likely-hood that the sample chosen would represent the population well, but there might also be a chance that it does not. Probability allows you to quantify how much a random sample may vary from a given population.
