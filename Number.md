## Javascript
Numbers in javascript are all just one type, number. They operate on the 64-bit floating point number scale. This meansÂ that it can store rather large numbers and both signed and unsigned numbers, numbers with decimals, and more.

Number(); can convert a string into a number

```javascript
let age = prompt("Enter your age");
console.log(Number(age));

```

```javascript
let intNr = 1; 
let decNr = 1.5; 
let expNr = 1.4e15; 
let octNr = 0o10; //decimal version would be 8  
let hexNr = 0x3E8; //decimal version would be 1000 
let binNr = 0b101; //decimal version would be 5
```
