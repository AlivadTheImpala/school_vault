In biology we need to understand the relationship between different species. All life on earth has its origins to a common ancestor and in order to find it scientists gather different data from species like, the structure of body parts, the sequence of amino acids in proteins or DNA, and use this data to build a Phylogenic Tree. 

**Phylogeny** is the history and relationships between different species and the study of organisms to find their relationships is called **systematics**

Although we have different classes now, new data is always being produced and new characteristics are found. Thus the tree of life is always evolving.

## The Levels of Classification
**Taxonomy** is the arrangement of and classification used to group species together. This system uses a hierarchichal model with the lowest being the most inclusive and then going into deeper specifity 

At the very bottom are the three Domains that hold all other species. Within that are the Kingdoms, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species at the deepest level.
