In biology we need to understand the relationship between different species. All life on earth has its origins to a common ancestor and in order to find it scientists gather different data from species like, the structure of body parts, the sequence of amino acids in proteins or DNA, and use this data to build a Phylogenic Tree. 

**Phylogeny** is the history and relationships between different species and the study of organisms to find their relationships is called **systematics**

Although we have different classes now, new data is always being produced and new characteristics are found. Thus the tree of life is always evolving.

## The Levels of Classification
**Taxonomy** is the arrangement of and classification used to group species together. This system uses a hierarchichal model with the lowest being the most inclusive and then going into deeper specifity 

At the very bottom are the three Domains that hold all other species. Within that are the Kingdoms, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species at the deepest level.

## The three Domains

## Classification and Phylogeny
unlike the Taxonomic system, Phylogenetic trees act as a sort of map for different species common ancesotors

Although Humans share a common ancestor with bonobos and chimpanzees, this does not mean that one evolved from the other. Humans did not evolve from chimps nor chimps evolve from humans. What is true is that each shared a common ancestor that exhibited traits similar to ours. 

The **branch point** refers to where a split occurs on the tree, and any lineages that stem from the same branch point are known as **sister taxa**. A branch point with more than two groups illustrates a situation for which scientists have not definitively determined relationships as is the case for the gorilla branch.

## Limitiations of Phylogenetic Trees
Phylogenetics trees are great to illustrate the order in which new traits where introduced into a population. However they dont show how much time has passed. A phylogenetic tree is also not indicative that because one trait evolved that another stopped. This all depends on context of where an organism lived and its environment.
