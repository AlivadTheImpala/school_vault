In biology we need to understand the relationship between different species. All life on earth has its origins to a common ancestor and in order to find it scientists gather different data from species like, the structure of body parts, the sequence of amino acids in proteins or DNA, and use this data to build a Phylogenic Tree. 

**Phylogeny** is the history and relationships between different species and the study of organisms to find their relationships is called **systematics**
