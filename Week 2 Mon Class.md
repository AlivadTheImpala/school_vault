What are atoms?
Atoms contain sub-atomic particles that all form to craete a single atom. These are [[Protons]], [[Neutrons]], and [[Electrons]]

Carbon dating uses carbon 14 to determine age. It has 6 protons and 8 neutrons.


## Ionic Bonds

What are Ionic Bonds?
Ionicly bonded atoms are held together because of their opposing electrical charges. NaCl sodium chloride. For an atom to change into an Ion, an atom needs to give or receive an electron from another atom.

Ionic Bonds form Compounds rather than molecules.

atoms vs. ions



How do electrons transfer to another atom?

In the image above, Na (sodium) is losing an electron. Initially, it had 11 protons and 11 electrons, meaning it had no net electrical charge. Since it loses an electron, the Na atom now has a positive electrical charge and becomes an Ion.

## Covalent Bonds
In these bonds, the atoms will share an electron rather than giving one up or receiving an electron

Covalent bonds are important biologically because they are what help form molecules.
