# Atoms
Atoms are made up of 3 parts
- [[Protons]] 
- [[Neutrons]]
- [[Electrons]]

The atomic mass of an atom combines the sum of protons and electrons since each possesses an atomic mass of 1. If there are an equivalent amount of protons to electrons, their atom's electrical charge is negated.

Each atom will contain a unique number of protons and neutrons. The protons determine the element the atom is. This is known as the element's [[atomic number]]. The atomic mass, or mass number, is the sum of the protons and neutrons. 


Different elements have different physical states at room temperature and a multitude of different qualities. Because of this, we use [[The Periodic Table of Elements]] to categorize each element.

## Isotopes

Isotopes are different forms of the same element. So, for example, Carbon has 6 protons. These 6 protons make carbon. Add one proton, and you would have Nitrogen, remove a proton, and you'd have Boron. 

Carbon-12 has six neutrons, so its atomic mass would be 12 (6 protons+6 neutrons), and its atomic number would be 6 (6 protons). Carbon-14 (6protons+8 neutrons). 

Radioisotopes are unstable isotopes, so they eventually lose a proton, other subatomic particles, or energy to turn into more stable elements.

# [[Chemical Bonds]]
___
Chemical bonds depend on how the electrons in two different atoms can interact. Whether they interact depends on there being an available space for an electron in a given atom. 

Electrons can occupy different energy levels surrounding the atom's nucleus that form layers above each other. 

The first layer can only hold 2 electrons. Looking at [[The Periodic Table of Elements]], you'll see that Hydrogen and Helium are the only two elements in the top row. Hydrogen has 1 electron, and Helium has two.

The Second and Third layers can each hold eight electrons. 

The row position of each element on the periodic table dictates how many rows of electrons the element contains. So the second row, which contains the elements of lithium (Li), beryllium (Be), boron (B), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), fluorine (F), and neon (Ne) all have the first two layers of electrons. **These all have electrons that occupy only the first and second shells. Lithium has only one electron in its outermost shell, beryllium has two electrons, boron has three, and so on, until the entire shell is filled with eight electrons, as is the case with neon.

The stability of an atom relies on the outermost shell of electrons being full. The less electrons in the outer shell, the more unstable the atom. This is the basis for [[Chemical Bonds]] and the formation of [[molecules]].

The [[octet rule]] is the rule used for low atomic number elements. Its a rule that states how elements will bond in order to maintain 8 electrons in each atoms outer shell


>[!From the Book] 
>Because the outermost shells of the elements with low atomic numbers (up to calcium, with atomic number 20) can hold eight electrons, this is referred to as the octet rule. An element can donate, accept, or share electrons with other elements to fill its outer shell and satisfy the octet rule.

### Ions
**Ions are formed when an atom has an unequal number of protons and electrons. 
- Cations are ions that have lost an electron and have a net positive charge.
- Anions are ions that have gained an electron and have a net negative charge.

>[!From the Book] 
>sodium only has one electron in its outermost shell. It takes less energy for sodium to donate that one electron than it does to accept seven more electrons to fill the outer shell. If sodium loses an electron, it now has 11 protons and only 10 electrons, leaving it with an overall charge of +1. It is now called a sodium ion.

Sodium and Chlorine are good examples of Ionic bonds. Since Chlorine has 7 electrons in its outermost shell, and Sodium only has one. It takes less energy for Chlorine to accept one electron than to donate 7 electrons to sodium. 

This results in Sodium having a net positive charge and Chlorine having a net negative charge.

## Ionic Bonds
Ionic bonds are strong interactions that require large amounts of energy input to break apart. Because one element loses an electron (net positive ion) and the other element gains an electron (negative ion), the two ions form a strong bond. 

## Covalent Bonds
Covalent bonds differ from ionic bonds in that the electrons between two elements is shared rather than gained or lost by another.
