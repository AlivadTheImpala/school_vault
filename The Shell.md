# Git Basics

## Git Syntax

git is written in the following format: **program | action | destination**

For example,

- `git add .` is read as  `git | add | .` where the period represents everything in the current directory;
- `git commit -m "message"` is read as `git | commit -m | "message"`; and
- `git status` is read as `git | status | (no destination)`.

## Basic Git Workflow
When working in your repository, eventually youll want to add your changes so that youre keeping track of your project. 

| Command    | Effect |
| ---------- | ------ |
| git status |  use this whenever you want to see the status of your local branch compared to your remote.      |
| git add    |        |
