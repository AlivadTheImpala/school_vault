# What is EJS
EJS is a way to create templates for the structure of your HTML, rather than creating the structure for every page manually. 

The closest thing I have that relates to this is using includes files with php. As in php, in ejs you can create your header and footer, that can be used across many different pages simply by specifying it in your page.
