# History
Althoug Charles Darwin comes up immediately, Darwin draws his work by those before him even as far back as Anaximander in 600 BC

Big Debate between geologists during Darwins Time postulating that big but infrequent changes leads to cataclysmic events that result in genetic variation. Others poustulated that these changes were actually very gradual and would play out over thousands of years and generations. 

# Evolution of insecticide resistance as an example of Natural Selection

A mutation in a gene that then allows resistance to an insectacide ( resistance can be multiple different changes, ie behaviour change or some way that the insecticide has no effect.) This leads to population growth of those that inherit the mutation.

Variation within a population is also necessary in order for certain traits to be better suited for certain environments.
