RAM: ram is a volatile memory, meaning that the memory that is stored there is only temporary and serves the purpose of reading data from an open applicaiton quickly, but the data is wiped when the computer is shut off.

ROM: similar to ROM in that its faster than a harddrive, but instead of being volatile it is non-volatile so even a power shutoff wont clear its memory. It'll typically hold the BIOS which is the first software that runs when a system boots and helps start the other computer processes.
