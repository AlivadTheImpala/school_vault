# 1.1|  What is the User Experience?

Three Defining Characteristics of User Experience:
1. A user is involved
2. User is interacting with a produc, system, or interface
3. User's experience is observable or measurable

## Differences between *Usability* and *User Experience*
While both terms do revolve around how a user interacts with something, **Usability** specifically looks at a users ability to carry out a succesful task. **UX** on the other hand is broader. It measures the users interaction with a system or product, as well as theur thoughts feelings and perceptions that result from the interation.

UX is often thought of along with User Interface (UI) and while UX is important in designing a user interface, UX and usability are prevelant in our more areas of society. Usability can have life and death consequences if a product or system is designed poorly. With a growing global population, more people act as potential users of increasingly complex products and systems, so having a good understanding of the user experience is important to decrease casualties.

# 1.2 | What are User Experience Metrics
Metrics are a way for us to consistently measure or evaluate something. Some Metrics of UX are:
- Task Success
- User satisfaction
- Errors
Metrics must be observable either directly or indirectly. They must also be quantifiable and turned into numbers. For example, a UX metric might reveal that 90% of the users are able to complete a set of tasks in less than 1 minute or 50% of users failed to notice a key element on the interface.

A good metric would measure something about the user and their interaction with the product. Whether it is *effective*, *efficient*, or *satisfactory* to use
