# What is the User Experience?

Three Defining Characteristics of User Experience:
1. A user is involved
2. User is interacting with a produc, system, or interface
3. User's experience is observable or measurable

## Differences between *Usability* and *User Experience*
While both terms do revolve around how a user interacts with something, **Usability** specifically looks at a users ability to carry out a succesful task. **UX** on the other hand is broader. It measures the users interaction with a system or product, as well as theur thoughts feelings and perceptions that result from the interation.
