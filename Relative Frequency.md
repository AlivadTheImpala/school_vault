Relative frequency is derived from the Empirical probability. To estimate the probability of event A, written P(A), we may repeat the random experiment many times and count the number of times event A occurs. Then P(A) is estimated by the ratio of the number of times A occurs to the number of repetitions, which is called theÂ **relative frequency of event A**.

>[!Note] 
>Thus the relative frequency for A to occur is (# of times A occurred)/(total repetitions)
