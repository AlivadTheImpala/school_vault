Relative frequency is derived from the Empirical probability. To estimate the probability of event A, written P(A), we may repeat the random experiment many times and count the number of times event A occurs. Then P(A) is estimated by the ratio of the number of times A occurs to the number of repetitions, which is called theÂ **relative frequency of event A**.

To come full circle, the relative frequency of something occuring is also the probability. In other words when seeking the probability, we are asking what the relative frequency is of that even to occur. The larger the sample size the closer to the true frequency
