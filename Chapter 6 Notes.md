# 6.1 | The Genome

## Genomic DNA

### Prokaryots
The Genome is essentially a cells complete compliment of DNA. Prokaryotic cells only have a single double stranded DNA molecule that makes up their genomes. All of its genetic information is stored in the nucleiod.

### Eukaryotes
The genome in eukaryotes by contrast is comprised of several double stranded DNA molecules, which are bound in proteins to form the structure of a chromasome. Every eukaryote species has a distinct number of chromosomes, humans contain 46. These human body cells, also known as somatic cells, contain two matched sets of chromosomes known as a diploid.. If you split the chromosome in half you get the 2 individual chromatids that make up 1 chromosome.

*n* represents a single set of chromosomes. Dispload is designated 2n. The matched pairs of chromosomes in a dipload are called homologous pairs. They are of similar length and contain specific genes in the same locations. These genes are what actually code for specific proteins that provide the different characteristics and traits in a species. The shape of earlobes is a characteristic with traits of free or attached.

A cell goes through a series of events that involve cell growth  and cell division.
