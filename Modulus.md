Modulus, denoted by %, determines the remainder of two numbers after they've been divided. 

so 15 % 4 would give you 3

Think about how many times you need to multiply 4 to get close to 15. you can multiply 4 by 3 and get 12, since thats as far as 4 can go into 15 you have 3 left over.

or 25 % 4 = 1 you can multiply 4 by 6 to get to 24, leaving 1 to get to the full 25.
