# 11.1 Discovering How Populations Change

Although Charles Darwin is best know for the theory of [[natural selection]], both he and Alfred Russel Wallace carried out research in search of this. 

There are 3 characteristics that Charles Darwin postulated:
1. Inherited Characteristics: Characteristics are passed down from parent to offspring
2. Surplus of Offspring: more offspring are produced than are able to survive given the limited resources in a given environment. Therefore there is **competition** every generation for those resources.
3. Offspring Variety: Offspring vary from each other, and those with characteristics that allow them to survive will then pass along those genes. Over generations this leads to those traits being more represented in subsequent generations leading to changes in populations. Darwin called this process "Descent with modification"

## Variation and Adaptation
For [[natural selection]] to occur, there needs to be genetic variation amongst individuals in a population. Being tall because of good nutrition wont pass down genes for being tall, you'd need to have an allele that codes for height.

Genetic diversity comes about in two ways:
1. Mutation
2. Sexual Reproduction

### Mutation
Mutation is the main source for new alleles in a population and can have 3 outcomes:
1. Lowered Fitness: a mutation may affect the phenotype of an individual in a way that lowers its likelihood of survival resulting in fewer offspring
2. Benefit to Fitness: the mutation may produce a [[phenotype]] that increases the individuals fitness leading to greater number of offspring
3. Neutral Mutation: mutation may have no effect on fitness. 
4. 
### Sexual Reproduction
In Sexual reproduction, crossing over during meisos leads to genetic diversity by combing in unique ways to produce unique genotypes/phenotypes. 

### Adaptation
An adaptation occurs when a heritable trait aids in the survival and reproduction of an organism within its environment. The adaptation is a "match" to an environment, meaning that over a period of time, the characteristics presented in populations is directly tied to the resource of the environment they live in. These adaptation though, will change to be favorable or disfavorable depending on the changes within the environment. 

Like in the case of the Galapagos finches, larger beaks were beneficial when there was a decline in smaller soft seeds. Seeds that smaller beaked finches relied on. If the environment changed however and smaller softer seeds were abundent, the population would change over time because now, it is no longer a negative to have a smaller beak.

## Patterns of Evolution

### Divergent Evolution

Divergent evolution occurs with a starting ancestor and branches off to form new species. Flowers are an example of this in that flowers will all share the same basic anatomy for reproduction, Their structure and pehnotype will be vastly different based on
