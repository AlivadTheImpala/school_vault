### Location
In terms of where you can find protists, they all share water in common. This can range from salt and freshwater environments, damp soil and snow. Many of them can be parasites which live either in or on another organism. Some even live on dead organisms or their waste and contribute to their decay.

### Structure
Protists are very unique. In general they are single celled organisms, but can also live in colonies of other protists while others can be multicellular. They can be multinucleated, meaning they have multiple nucleus with different functions.
