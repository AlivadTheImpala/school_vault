Imagine that your team decides to create a web page that displays the top contributors (that is, authors, coauthors, and editors) in your database. They decide to enlist the services of an external developer to create an app in React JavaScript. To integrate with the Django backend, the developer will need an endpoint that provides the following:

- A list of all contributors in the database
- For each contributor, a list of all books they contributed to
- For each contributor, the number of books they contributed to
- For each book they contributed to, their role in the book
