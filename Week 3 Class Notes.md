# Review Questions from reading
3. 4 parts of all cells
	1. Cell membrane 
	2. Cytoplasm
	3. DNA
	4. Ribosomes
5. Physical features to distinguish prokaryotic and eukaryotic
	1. Nucleus present in eukaryotic but not prokaryotic cells.
	2. General size differences, prokaryotes are usually much smaller
	3. Generally, prokaryotics are only unicellular and not multicellular, Nostoc filaments are an example of prokaryotes that form chains together and appear to be multicellular, but are all just individual cells grabbing onto each other.
9. What Structural polysaccharide is found in plant cell walls? Why does that molecule matter to us?
	1. Cellulose is important to humans because it is an abundant polymer that can be used for papers and building materials. Humans can't digest it, but the fibers can help with our digestive tract.
10. What is DNA for:
	1. instructions for making proteins that allow cells to form and reproduce.


Terms to know
**Phospholipids**: create a hydrophobic layer of the cell membrane to protect the internals from the external environment. The cell membrane is made of phospholipids, proteins, and carbohydrates.
Diffusion: particles tend to move from areas of high concentration, to areas of lower concentration to take up the available space
**Osmosis**: Movement of water molecules across some sort of barrier, living or otherwise.

Simple and Facilitated diffusion
	**Simple Diffusion**: water molecules wouldn't be able to move from one side of a cell membrane to the other because the cell membrane phospholipid layer is hydrophobic. A lipid would be able to move through this phospholipid layer though since theyre both lipids, ergo no facilitation is needed.
	**Facilitated diffusion**: in order for water to move through the phospholipid layer it needs a way to move across. a protein channel helps facilitate this movement.

Isotonic Solution
Water concentration inside the cell and outside the cell is the same 

Hypertonic Solution
Water is in higher concentration within a cell than outside the cell, so the water exits the cell due to diffusion, this collapses the cell. 

Hypotonic Solution
Water concentration is lower in the cell vs outside the cell so water will move into the cell, engroging the cell. eventually no more water could come in and youd have an isotonic situation in a cell plant (the cell membrane would reach the cell wall and it would no longer be able to expand). in an animal cell, the cell would burst and die. 

## Passive transport
