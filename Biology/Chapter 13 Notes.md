# 13.3 | Protists

## Characteristics of Protists
In general, **Protists** are eukaryotic organisms that do not fit into any of the other kingdoms of Animalia, Fungi, or Plantae. Though they are all [[Eukaryotes]]

### Location
In terms of where you can find protists, they all share water in common. This can range from salt and freshwater environments, damp soil and snow. Many of them can be parasites which live either in or on another organism. Some even live on dead organisms or their waste and contribute to their decay.

### Structure
Protists are very unique. In general they are single celled organisms, but can also live in colonies of other protists while others can be multicellular. They can be multinucleated, meaning they have multiple nucleus with different functions.

When it comes to movement, most protists are motile. They may have one or more flagella, others have cilia all over there bodies that they coordinate to provide movement. Some function like spidermans webs. They send out psuedopodia from anywhere on the cell, it attaches to a substrate, and pulls the rest of the cell to the anchor point.

### Energy Production
Protists, again, are very very different from each other. Some can photosynthesize while others are hetertrophs, meaning they can consume organic material (such as other organisms), digest it, and then poop out the remains. Ingestion is [[phagocytosis]] and pooping is [[exocytosis]].
