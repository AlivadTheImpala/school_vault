# 3.1 | How Cells are Studied

## Microscopy
There are many methods of viewing cells for study. 
- Light Microscopes
- Dissecting Microscopes 
- Electron Microscopes
An Electron microscope uses electrons and metal, like gold, to pass along the surface of the cells. This allows greater levels of magnification. Because these microscopes require a vacuum environment, you cant use them to view *living* cells.

# 3.4 | The Cell Membrane

The [[Plasma Membrane]] is meant to allow only certain substances in and out, in order to control what interacts with the internals of the cell. They carry markers that allow each cell to identify the other. It's these markers that certain viruses have evolved to interact with. The virus mimics the substance a cell is looking for, allowing the virus to bind to the cell. 

## Fluid Mosaic Model
Created in in 1972 by S.J Singer and Garth L Nicolson

The bilayer phospholipids of the cell membrane mean that it has two layers. The polar ends, as shown in the artist's rendition above, are spherical and hydrophilic, meaning water is attracted to them. The inner portion, between the two layers, is the fatty acid tails, which are hydrophobic. 

Proteins, carbs, glycolipids, glycoproteins, and cholesterol in animal cells, are embedded within the cell membrane. The cholesterol in animal cells acts as a sort of antifreeze, controlling the fluidity of the membrane. 

The embedded proteins act as a channel for some materials to pass through the cell membrane. There are peripheral proteins that are located either on the interior portion of the cell membrane or on the external side, and integral proteins are the channels into and out of the cell. Both, however, can also act as enzymes and structural stability of the cell membrane by connecting to the fibers of the cytoskeleton or act as part of the cell's recognition system.

Carbs are located on the exterior surface of cells and are bound to proteins (glycoproteins) or lipids (glycolipids). These carbs form chains of 2-60 monosaccharides units. They also function as identifying markers for other cells.

# 3.5 | Passive Transport

[[Passive transport]]
[[Concentration gradient]]

>[!Notes]
>Passive transport does not require energy input from a cell in order to take place.

## Selective Permeability
Plasma membranes are asymmetrical in nature. The outer portion is the hydrophilic layer, while the inner core is hydrophobic. This hydrophobic layer prevents certain substances from gaining entry into the cell. Other substances like lipid-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) can easily pass through the lipid core of a cell membrane. 

Polar substances have a problem passing through the lipid layer, this is where the integrated glycoproteins and glycolipids come into play, allowing a cell to bind with the external substances it needs. 

## Diffusion
Diffusion is a method of [[Passive transport]]. A single substance wants to move from an area of high concentration of that substance to an area of lower concentration. This basically means that the substance wants to spread evenly across a physical space. In the context of the macroworld, if you were to fart in a room, the initial high concentration is the origin of the fart. Those odor particles will want to spread out evenly across the given space of the room until there is an even distribution between them.

Each substance in a given space will have its own [[concentration gradient]]

## Facilitated Transport
Remember that some substances have difficulty passing through the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane. In this case, the integrated proteins act as a transport or tunnel that they can pass through. These proteins are known as transport proteins.

## Osmosis
Osmosis is the diffusion of water through a semipermeable membrane according to the [[concentration gradient]] of water across the membrane. Osmosis is specific to water, unlike diffusion, which deals with other substances.

## Tonicity
This describes the amount of solute in a solution. The measure of this tonicity is called its osmolarity. This is how much of a solute is dissolved in a particular solution. 

To relate the osmolarity of the extracellular fluid around the cell to the osmolarity *within* the cell, we use three terms. The Cytoplasm is the point of reference in living systems.

- Hypotonic Solution
- Hypertonic Solution
- Isotonic Solution

**Hypotonic solutions** like water, the extracellular fluid has a lower concentration of solutes than the fluid inside the cell. This means that there is more water in the extracellular fluid than inside the cell, causing water to flow into the cell (lower concentration of water in the cell). **This can cause the cell to burst, aka lyse, in an animal cell.**

**Hypertonic solutions** such as seawater, the extracellular fluid contains less water than a cell. Because of this, water will move outside the cell, effectively drawing water out of the cell.

**Isotonic solutions** have the same osmolarity inside the cell and extracellular fluid. This means there is no movement of water into or out of the cell.

Plants, fungi, bacteria, and some protists have cell walls that surround the plasma membrane and can create turgor pressure. This is the pressure applied to the cell walls that provide rigidity to plants.

# 3.6 | Active Transport

>[!Note]
>Active transport requires the use of a cell's energy usually in the form of ATP

## Electromechanical Gradient
[[Concentration gradient]] 

Like [[concentration gradient]], cells also carry an electrical charge that is different than the extracellular fluid that surrounds a cell. The interior of cells is made up of many proteins, which are typically negatively charged. Because Ions move into and out of cells, there is something called the [[electrical gradient]]. 

**Potassium** (K+) and sodium (Na+) both exist inside of a cell, but there is a much higher concentration of potassium than there is sodium. Because of the low concentration of Sodium present in a cell (low concentration gradient) and Sodium's positive charge (electrical gradient), the ion is driven inwards toward the negatively charged cell (opposite attraction). 


Potassium, which is positively charged, is a bit more complex. Its positive charge(electrical gradient) drives it inward into the negatively charged cell, but its higher concentration within the cell promotes diffusion out of the cell (concentration gradient).

The combined measure of the concentration gradient and electrical gradient on an ion is known as the electromechanical gradient.
